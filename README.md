# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a credit card customer will leave (churn) or stay with the bank. It uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze customer data and make predictions.

## What This Project Does

- Loads and explores customer data
- Cleans and prepares the data for analysis
- Uses one-hot encoding for categorical features
- Scales the data for better model performance
- Builds and trains a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluates the model's accuracy and performance

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook `credit-card-customer-churn-prediction.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells step by step to see the data analysis and model training process.

## Main Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow / keras
- matplotlib

## Project Highlights

- Simple and clear explanations in the notebook
- Easy-to-follow code for beginners
- Visualizations to help understand the results

## Why This Project?

Understanding why customers leave helps banks improve their services and keep more customers. This project shows a practical way to use data science for real business problems.
